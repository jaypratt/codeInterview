Diplay top 10 results with: id, original_title, pupularity, poster_path (filter out other data during webService stage) \
\
Documentation: \         
Followed instructions for Express and was able to get a "hello world" page started \
Generated key for TMDB api calls \
Created account in postman to test api calls (works) \
Attempting to learn javascript on the fly to make api calls \
Found that fetch was the best method to use, but no way to test it yet \
Decided to try and cut losses on making the WebService functional, and work on WebApp for something to show \
Downloaded and installed Vue.JS, and got confused on what exactly it's supposed to do for me, or what's special about it. \
Realized that computer files were not uploading to github easily, so decided to upload what I had to github to be within the 4 hour time limit.
